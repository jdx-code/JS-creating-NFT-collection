# JS-creating-NFT-collection
This is the final assesment from MetaCrafters JS Essentials Course.

This project assesment has a little Web3 spice for flavor! Here, I have minted NFTs! Ok, not really, but I have pretended to do so. I simulated this by writing some JavaScript code that creates an object representing an NFT and that holds the metadata for the NFT. I have attempted to create NFT collections of IPL (Indian Premier League) teams. Each NFT that is minted will contain metadata as - teamName, jerseyColor, titlesWon, owner and captain. 

Just open the file in VS-Code and run the file on your terminal !!
